# dotvim

This is my Vim configuration, feel free to use it!

Create a link to the vimrc file:

ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

You have to do:

git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

as well before running Vim to be able to run Vundle.

To be able to use Tagbar, you need to install Exuberant ctags.
